We're looking at some traffic stops!

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("../data/burlington-police-stops/stops.csv")
```


```{python}
cols = ["subject_age", "subject_race", "subject_sex", "search_conducted", "reason_for_stop"]

df = df[cols]
df.dropna(inplace=True)

y = df["search_conducted"].astype(int)
X = pd.get_dummies(df[["subject_age", "subject_race", "subject_sex", "reason_for_stop"]], drop_first=True)





```

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

y.mean()


model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X, y)
model.score(X, y)

```
