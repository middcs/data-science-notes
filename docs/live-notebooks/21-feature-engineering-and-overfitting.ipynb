This variable needs to be log10 transformed for modeling.\n",
    "- `Lake_Temp_C`: Lake temperature in degrees Celsius\n",
    "- `WaveHt_Ft`: Wave height, measured with a yardstick at the site at the same time the E. coli sample was collected, USGS parameter code 70224.  The square root of this variable is used in the model.\n",
    "- `Lake_Turb_NTRU`: *Turbidity, measured with a portable turbidimeter from a sample collected at the same time the E. coli sample was collected, USGS parameter code 63676. The log10 of this variable is used in the model.*\n",
    "- `LL_PreDay`: Lake level change over the last 24 hours (8 a.m. today-8 a.m. yesterday), NOAA Station 9063063 at Cleveland, Ohio., accessed at https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/\n",
    "- `AirportRain48W_in`: Rainfall, cumulated sums for the past 48 hours, giving the most weight to the most recent value, as follows: (2 * Dm1) + Dm2.  DM1 is the 24-hour total up to 8 a.m. on the day the E. coli sample was collected; DM2 is the rain 2 days ago, Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, Ohio, site USW00014820, accessed at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/. The square root of this variable is used in the model.\n"
