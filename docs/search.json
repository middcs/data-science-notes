    "text": "Supervised Learning\nOur focus in these notes is almost exclusively on supervised learning. In supervised learning, we are able to view some attributes or features of a data point, which we call predictors. Traditionally, we collect these attributes into a vector called \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Each data point then has a target, which could be either a scalar number or a categorical label. Traditionally, the target is named \\(y\\). We aim to predict the target based on the predictors using a model, which is a function \\(f\\). The result of applying the model \\(f\\) to the predictors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is our prediction or predicted target \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\), to which we often give the name \\(\\hat{y}\\). Our goal is to choose \\(f\\) such that the predicted target \\(\\hat{y}\\) is equal to, or at least close to, the true target \\(y\\). We could summarize this with the heuristic statement:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\text{``}f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\hat{y} \\approx y\\;.\\text{''}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHow we interpret this heuristic statement depends on context. In regression problems, this statement typically means “\\(\\hat{y}\\) is usually close to \\(y\\)”, while in classification problems this statement usually means that “\\(\\hat{y} = y\\) exactly most or all of the time.”\nIn our regression example from above, we can think of a function \\(f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) that maps the predictor \\(x\\) to the prediction \\(\\hat{y}\\). In the case of classification, things are a little more complicated. Although the function \\(g(x_1) = 1 - x_1\\) is visually very relevant, that function is not itself the model we use for prediction. Instead, our prediction function should return one classification label for points on one side of the line defined by that function, and a different label for points on the other side. If we say that blue points are labeled \\(0\\) and brown points are labeled \\(1\\), then our predictor function can be written \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}\\), and it could be written heuristically like this:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    f(\\mathbf{x}) &= \\mathbb{1}[\\mathbf{x} \\text{ is above the line}] \\\\\n                  &= \\mathbb{1}[x_1 + x_2 \\geq 1] \\\\\n                  &= \\mathbb{1}[x_1 + x_2 - 1\\geq 0]\\;.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis last expression looks a little clunky, but we will soon find out that it is the easiest one to generalize to an advanced setting.",

    "text": "Data Preparation\nWe can select our desired columns from the data frame, operate on them, and make assignments to them using the data-frame-as-dictionary paradigm explored in Vanderplas (2016).\nIn applied data science, at least 80% of the work is typically spent acquiring and preparing data. Here, we’re going to do some simple data preparation directed by our question. It’s going to be convenient to shorten the Species column for each penguin. Furthermore, for visualization purposes today we are going to focus on the Culmen Length (mm) and Culmen Depth (mm) columns.\n\n# use only these three columns\ndf = df[[\"Culmen Length (mm)\", \"Culmen Depth (mm)\", \"Species\"]] \n\n# remove any rows that have missing data in any of the selected columns. \ndf = df.dropna()\n\n# slightly advanced syntax: \n# replace the column with the first word in each entry\ndf[\"Species\"] = df[\"Species\"].str.split().str.get(0)\n\nLet’s take a look at what we’ve done so far:\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulmen Length (mm)\nCulmen Depth (mm)\nSpecies\n\n\n\n\n0\n39.1\n18.7\nAdelie\n\n\n1\n39.5\n17.4\nAdelie\n\n\n2\n40.3\n18.0\nAdelie\n\n\n4\n36.7\n19.3\nAdelie\n\n\n5\n39.3\n20.6\nAdelie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs another preprocessing step, we are going to add transformed labels represented as integers.\n\n# for later: assign an integer to each species\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\nle = LabelEncoder()\ndf[\"species_label\"] = le.fit_transform(df[\"Species\"])\n\nfor i, c in enumerate(le.classes_):\n    print(f\"Class number {i} represents {c} penguins.\")\n\nClass number 0 represents Adelie penguins.\nClass number 1 represents Chinstrap penguins.\nClass number 2 represents Gentoo penguins.\n\n\nNow our data looks like this:\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulmen Length (mm)\nCulmen Depth (mm)\nSpecies\nspecies_label\n\n\n\n\n0\n39.1\n18.7\nAdelie\n0\n\n\n1\n39.5\n17.4\nAdelie\n0\n\n\n2\n40.3\n18.0\nAdelie\n0\n\n\n4\n36.7\n19.3\nAdelie\n0\n\n\n5\n39.3\n20.6\nAdelie\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrain-Test Split\nWhen designing predictive models, it’s important to evaluate them in a context that simulates the prediction application as accurately as possible. One important way we do this is by performing a train-test split. We keep most of the data as training data which we’ll use to design the model. We’ll hold out a bit of the data as testing data, which we’ll treat as unseen and only use once we are ready to evaluate our final design. The testing data simulates the idea of “new, unseen data” – exactly the kind of data on which it would be useful for us to make predictions!\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\ndf_train, df_test = train_test_split(df, test_size = 0.2)\n\nLet’s check the size of our two split data sets:\n\ndf_train.shape, df_test.shape\n\n((273, 4), (69, 4))\n\n\nNow we’re going to forget that df_test exists for a while.

    "text": "Data Analysis and Visualization\nAs a first step, it’s useful to understand how many of each species there are in the training data:\nThis is an example of a “split-apply-combine” operation (Wickham 2011). We split the dataframe into three groups depending on the species label, apply an operation (in this case, computing the number of rows), and then combine the results into a single object. Pandas implements split-apply-combine primarily through the groupby method and several associated functions. There are some nice examples of split-apply-combine in Pandas in Vanderplas (2016).\n\ndf_train.groupby(\"Species\").size()\n\nSpecies\nAdelie       122\nChinstrap     55\nGentoo        96\ndtype: int64\n\n\nThere are more Adelie penguins than Chintraps or Gentoos in this data set. Here are the proportions:\n\ndf_train.groupby(\"Species\").size() / df_train.shape[0] # divide by total rows\n\nSpecies\nAdelie       0.446886\nChinstrap    0.201465\nGentoo       0.351648\ndtype: float64\n\n\nSo, over 40% of the penguins in the data are Adelie penguins. One important consequence of this proportion is the base rate of the classification problem. The base rate refers to how well we could perform at prediction if we did not use any kind of predictive modeling, but instead simply predicted the most common class for every penguin. Here, if we always predicted “Adelie” for the species, we’d expect to be right more than 40% of the time. So, a minimal expectation of anything fancier we do is that it should be correct much more than 40% of the time.\nNow let’s take a look at our (training) data and see whether our chosen columns look like they have a chance of predicting the penguin species. We’ll show the plot both without and with the species labels.\n\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (8, 3.5))\n\np1 = sns.scatterplot(df_train, x = \"Culmen Length (mm)\", y = \"Culmen Depth (mm)\", ax = ax[0], color = \"darkgrey\")\np2 = sns.scatterplot(df_train, x = \"Culmen Length (mm)\", y = \"Culmen Depth (mm)\", hue = \"Species\", style = \"Species\", ax = ax[1])\n\n\n\n\nThese plots are generated using the Seaborn library for Python. Seaborn is a high-level wrapper around the classical matplotlib library for data visualization. Although Matplotlib is very flexible, Seaborn is optimized for visualizing data contained in Pandas data frames. You can find many examples of creating Seaborn plots in the official gallery, and many tips and examples for matplotlib in Vanderplas (2016).\n\n\n\n\nWe can think of the lefthand side as “what the model will see:” just physiological measurements with no labels. On the right we can see the data with its species labels included. We can see that the species are divided into clusters: Adelie penguins have measurements which tend to be similar to other Adelies; Chinstraps are similar to other Chinstraps, etc.\nThis pattern is promising! The approximate separation of the species suggests that a machine learning model which predicts the species label from these measurements is likely to be able to beat the base rate.",

For now, you can think of these models as black-box algorithms that accept predictor variables as inputs and return a predicted target as an output. In our case, the predictor variables are the culmen length and culmen depth columns, while the target we are attempting to predict is the species. Later on, we’ll learn more about how some of these models actually work.\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC # support vector classifier\nfrom mlxtend.plotting import plot_decision_regions # for visualization later\n\nIt’s convenient to split our data into predictors \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and targets \\(\\mathbf{y}\\).

Let’s try logistic regression! In the Scikit-learn API, we first need to instantiate the LogisticRegression() class, and then call the fit() method of this class on the training predictors and targets.\n\nLR = LogisticRegression()\nm = LR.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nSo, uh, did it work? The LogisticRegression() class includes a handy method to compute the accuracy of the classifier:\n\nLR.score(X_train, y_train)\n\n0.9633699633699634\n\n\nWow! Much better than the base rate. Note that this is the accuracy on the training data. In theory, accuracy on the test data could look very different.\nA useful way to visualize models with two numerical predictors is via decision regions. Each region describes the set of possible measurements that would result in a given classification.\nYou can unfold this code to see a simple implementation of a function for plotting decision regions which wraps the plot_decision_regions function of the mlxtend package.\n\n\nCode\ndef decision_regions(X, y, model, title):\n\n    with warnings.catch_warnings():\n        warnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")\n        ax = plot_decision_regions(X_train.to_numpy(), y_train.to_numpy(), clf = model, legend = 2)\n\n        handles, labels = ax.get_legend_handles_labels()\n        ax.legend(handles, \n                le.classes_, \n                framealpha=0.3, scatterpoints=1)\n\n        ax.set(xlabel = \"Culmen Length (mm)\", ylabel = \"Culmen Depth (mm)\", title = f\"{title}: Accuracy = {model.score(X, y):.3f}\")\n\ndecision_regions(X_train, y_train, LR, \"Decision Regions for Logistic Regression\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about how support vector machines work in Vanderplas (2016). We’ll also study these models later in the course.\nWhile we’re at it, let’s try fitting a different classifier, also supplied by Scikit-learn. This classifier is called support vector machine (SVM).\n\nSVM = SVC(gamma = 5)\nSVM.fit(X_train, y_train)\ndecision_regions(X_train, y_train, SVM, \"Decision Regions for Support Vector Machine\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow! The support vector machine classifier achieved even higher accuracy on the training data. This is enabled by the greater flexibility of the SVM. Flexibility comes from a lot of places in machine learning, and generally refers to the ability of models to learn complicated decision boundaries like the ones shown here.\nBut is this increased flexibility a good thing? You might look at this predictor and think that something funny is going on. For example, shouldn’t a point on the bottom right be more likely to be a Gentoo penguin than an Adelie?…\n\nSimulating Evaluation: Cross-Validation\nNow we have two competing classification models: logistic regression and support vector machine. Which one is going to do the best job of prediction on totally new, unseen data? We could go ahead and evaluate on our test set, but for statistical reasons we need to avoid doing this until we’ve made a final choice of classifier.\nVanderplas (2016) has more on cross-validation and overfitting. We’ll confront overfitting agian many times in this course.\nIn order to make an assessment, we can simulate the process of fitting the model and evaluating on “test” data by witholding parts of our training data to use as testing. We split the data into chunks and withold each chunk, using the other chunks to train the data. This is called cross-validation, and it is illustrated in this figure:\n\n\n\nImage source: scikit-learn\n\n\nWe could do this with a janky for-loop, but the nice scikit-learn developers have implemented this for us. Here’s an example of cross-validation with 5 folds. This can take a little while, as there are actually 5 calls to model.fit() happening under the hood each time.\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n\nFirst let’s compute the cross-validation accuracies for logistic regression:\n\ncv_scores_LR = cross_val_score(LR, X_train, y_train, cv=5)\ncv_scores_LR\n\narray([0.945, 1.   , 0.945, 0.963, 0.963])\n\n\nA convenient way to summarize these results is by computing the average:\n\ncv_scores_LR.mean()\n\nnp.float64(0.9633670033670032)\n\n\nLet’s compare to SVM:\n\ncv_scores_SVM = cross_val_score(SVM, X_train, y_train, cv=5)\ncv_scores_SVM.mean()\n\nnp.float64(0.8684175084175084)\n\n\nAh! It looks like our SVM classifier was indeed too flexible to do well in predicting data that it hasn’t seen before. Although the SVM had better training accuracy than the logistic regression model, it failed to generalize to the task of unseen prediction. This phenomenon is called overfitting. Dealing with overfitting is one of the fundamental modeling challenges in applied machine learning.",

    "text": "Model Evaluation\nSo far, we’ve fit a logistic regression model and a support vector machine model; compared the two on a cross-validation task; and determined that the logistic regression model is most likely to generalize. Let’s now retrain the logistic regression model on the complete training data and finally evaluate it on the test set:\n\nLR.fit(X_train,y_train) \nLR.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n0.9710144927536232\n\n\nNot bad! This is our final estimate for the accuracy of our model as a classification tool on unseen penguin data.\n\nBeyond Accuracy\nAccuracy is a simple measure of how many errors a model makes. In many applications, it’s important to understand what kind of errors the model makes, a topic which we’ll study much more when we come to decision theory in the near future. We can get a quick overview of the kinds of mistakes that a model makes by computing the confusion matrix between the true labels and predictions. This matrix cross-tabulates all the true labels with all the predicted ones.\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n\ny_test_pred = LR.predict(X_test)\nC = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_test_pred)\nC\n\narray([[28,  1,  0],\n       [ 0, 13,  0],\n       [ 0,  1, 26]])\n\n\nThe entry in the ith row and jth column of the confusion matrix gives the number of data points that have true label i and predicted label j from our model.\n\nfor i in range(3):\n    for j in range(3):\n        print(f\"There were {C[i,j]} {le.classes_[i]} penguin(s) who were classified as {le.classes_[j]}.\")\n\nThere were 28 Adelie penguin(s) who were classified as Adelie.\nThere were 1 Adelie penguin(s) who were classified as Chinstrap.\nThere were 0 Adelie penguin(s) who were classified as Gentoo.\nThere were 0 Chinstrap penguin(s) who were classified as Adelie.\nThere were 13 Chinstrap penguin(s) who were classified as Chinstrap.\nThere were 0 Chinstrap penguin(s) who were classified as Gentoo.\nThere were 0 Gentoo penguin(s) who were classified as Adelie.\nThere were 1 Gentoo penguin(s) who were classified as Chinstrap.\nThere were 26 Gentoo penguin(s) who were classified as Gentoo.",

    "text": "Recap\nIn these notes, we took a very quick tour of the core data science workflow. We considered a simple classification problem in which we acquired some data, cleaned it up a bit, visualized several of its features, used those features to make a predictive classification model, visualized that model, and evaluated its accuracy. Along the way, we encountered the phenomenon of overfitting: models that are too flexible will achieve remarkable accuracy on the training set but will generalize poorly to unseen data. The problem of designing models that are “flexible enough” and “in the right way” is a fundamental driving force in modern machine learning, and the deep learning revolution can be viewed as the latest paradigm for seeking appropriately flexible models.\nSo far, we haven’t attempted to understand how any of these predictive models actually work. We’ll dive into this topic soon.",
